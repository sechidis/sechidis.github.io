    "text": "Hello, my name is Konstantinos (for short, Kostas) Sechidis and I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. I work in the Advanced Methodology and Data Science group of Novartis and specialize in exploratory analysis for biomarker discovery, digital biomarker development, and assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. I did my PhD in Machine Learning in the University of Manchester and subsequently I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with AstraZeneca and Roche. I am honorary research fellow in Machine Learning and Robotics in the University of Manchester, while I am also a member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal (MLJ) and the chair of the technical committee on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).\n Disclaimer: this is my personal page, the content is my own responsibility and it is not connected to/supported by any entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated. \n\nNews\nMay 2025: I am happy to share our recent paper that is a product of a cross-industry collaboration initiated by the EFSPI (European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry) SIG in Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (TEH). In this paper, we investigate the intersection of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) modeling and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to enhance the understanding of individual responses to treatments and the contribution of features in model predictions. Additionally, we provide guidance on using SHAP values to identify predictive biomarkers in CATE modeling. A big thanks to David Svensson for leading this work, and to my co-authors Erik Hermansson, Nikolaos Nikolaou and Ilya Lipkovich.\nApril 2025: Our latest paper on arXiv illustrates the implementations of WATCH in the context of parametric regression models, highlighting the practical and flexible use of score-residual based methods for identifying treatment effect modifiers. A big thanks to Sophie Sun, Yao Chen and Björn Bornkampfor leading this work.\nMarch 2025: I am happy to present our recent work on assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials at various events, including the AI in Healthcare seminars at the University of Manchester, DAGstat 2025, and the ISBS webinar series.\nFebruary 2025: In our new paper Using Individualized Treatment Effects to Assess Treatment Effect Heterogeneity we introduce methodologies for assessing heterogeneity using individualized treatment effects as a basis. These methods can be used to implement our recently proposed WATCH workflow for binary and continuous endpoints. A big thanks to my Novartis co-authors (Cong Zhang, Sophie Sun, Yao Chen, Björn Bornkamp) and Asher Spector for a great collobartion.\nJanuary 2025: Laura’s work on using low-precision conditional mutual information (CMI) for feature selection is published in Pattern Recognition.\nNovember 2024: I am pleased to announce my appointment as the chair of the technical committee on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques of (IAPR).
