    "text": "Hello, my name is Konstantinos (for short, Kostas) Sechidis and I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. I work in the Advanced Methodology and Data Science group of Novartis and specialize in exploratory analysis for biomarker discovery, digital biomarker development, and assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. I did my PhD in Machine Learning in the University of Manchester and subsequently I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with AstraZeneca and Roche. I am honorary research fellow in Machine Learning and Robotics in the University of Manchester, while I am also a member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal (MLJ) and the chair of the technical committee on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).\n Disclaimer: this is my personal page, the content is my own responsibility and it is not connected to/supported by any entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated. \n\nNews\nNovember 2025: Happy to share our new paper with Lasse, where we introduce post-hoc knockoff method that uses e-values to adapt the nominal level while preserving full Type I error guarantees. In this way, we can increase the nominal level in cases where the original knockoff procedure does not make any selections to potentially make discoveries, and in cases where it does make discoveries, we can often decrease the nominal level to increase the precision.\nAugust 2025: Alberto’s work on vocal markers of schizophrenia and the generalizability of machine learning models is published in Schizophrenia Bulletin.\nMay 2025: I am happy to share our recent paper that is a product of a cross-industry collaboration initiated by the EFSPI (European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry) SIG in Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (TEH). In this paper, we investigate the intersection of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) modeling and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to enhance the understanding of individual responses to treatments and the contribution of features in model predictions. Additionally, we provide guidance on using SHAP values to identify predictive biomarkers in CATE modeling. A big thanks to David Svensson for leading this work, and to my co-authors Erik Hermansson, Nikolaos Nikolaou and Ilya Lipkovich.\nApril 2025: Our latest paper on arXiv illustrates the implementations of WATCH in the context of parametric regression models, highlighting the practical and flexible use of score-residual based methods for identifying treatment effect modifiers.
