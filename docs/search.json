For developing digital biomarkers, sensor data (such as motion detection, audio and video) are analysed and, by using advanced machine learning methods, are transformed to meaningful markers. My fellowship focused on developing a speech emotion recognition system as a digital biomarker for patients with Parkinson’s disease. I worked both with real-world and clinical trial data and I used machine learning modelling to discover novel insights on the emotional content of the parkinsonian speech. You can find more details in this presentation.\nData Science Fellow in Personalised Healthcare, AstraZeneca & University of Manchester\nMy fellowship focused on developing machine learning approaches for predictive biomarker discovery, i.e. biomarkers that convey information over the treatment efficacy. Furthermore, a methodology to quantify the robustness of biomarker discovery algorithms was developed. I worked with two clinical trials, one for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and one for the prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.\nPost-doctoral Researcher, Health e-Research Center & University of Manchester\nMy post-doc focused on developing machine learning techniques for correcting under-reported biases in self-reported epidemiological data. I worked with Born in Bradford database.\nPhD Researcher, University of Manchester My PhD was in statistical machine learning, and particularly, in developing hypothesis testing and feature selection methods for semi-supervised data. It was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Propondis Foundation and my supervisor was Professor Gavin Brown. My PhD awarded the best thesis in the Department of Computer Science, while my work on developing a methodology for sample size determination in partially labelled data got the best student paper award in ECML/PKDD 2014."
