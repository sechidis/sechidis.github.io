    "text": "About\nI am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. In 2020 I joined Novartis’ Advanced Methodology and Data Science group, which focuses on developing new machine learning methods with the aim of improving drug development in multiple projects. I am member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal (MLJ) and vice-chair of the technical committee on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).\nI did my PhD in statistical machine learning on the area of hypothesis testing and feature selection in semi-supervised scenarios in the University of Manchester’s Department of Computer Science. Afterwards, I spent many years as post-doctoral researcher on developing novel methodologies for analysing: self-reported epidemiological data with Manchester’s Health e-Research Center, clinical trials data for personalised medicine with AstraZeneca and digital healthcare data for digital biomarker development with Roche.\n Disclaimer: this is my personal page, the content is my own responsibility and it is not connected to/supported by any entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated. \n\n\nKey research interests\n\nFeature selection\nInformation theory\nBiomarker discovery for personalised healthcare\nDigital biomarker discovery\nMulti-target learning\n\n\n\nNews\nNov 2023: Gave an invited presentation in the European Statistical Forum. This year’s topic was: Statistical Methodology in Precision Medicine and the role of Artificial Intelligence.\nSep 2023: Present our work on controlled biomarker discovery in the 5th Conference of the Central European Network (CEN).\nJan 2023: I have been appointed vice-chair of the technical committee on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).\nDec 2022: Our paper on benchmarking methods for characterising treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials published in Biometrical Journal.
