# About
I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. In 2020 I joined [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/)' Advanced Methodology and Data Science group, which focuses on developing new machine learning methods with the aim of improving drug development in multiple projects. I am member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal [(MLJ)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994/editors) and vice-chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).

I did my PhD in statistical machine learning on the area of hypothesis testing and feature selection in semi-supervised scenarios in the University of Manchester's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/). Afterwards, I spent many years as post-doctoral researcher on developing novel methodologies for analysing: self-reported epidemiological data with Manchester's [Health e-Research Center](https://www.herc.ac.uk/), clinical trials data for personalised medicine with [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) and digital healthcare data for digital biomarker development with [Roche](https://www.roche.com/).

**Sep 2023**: Present our work on controlled biomarker discovery in the [5th Conference of the Central European Network (CEN)](https://cen2023.github.io/home/index.html).

**Jan 2023**: I have been appointed vice-chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).

**Dec 2022**: Our paper on benchmarking methods for characterising treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials published in [Biometrical Journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bimj.202100337). If you are interested on simulating datasets of heterogeneous treatment effects you can check our [benchtm](https://github.com/Sophie-Sun/benchtm) package.
