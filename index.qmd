Hello, my name is Konstantinos (for short, Kostas) Sechidis and I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. I work in the Advanced Methodology and Data Science group of [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) and specialize in exploratory analysis for biomarker discovery, digital biomarker development, and assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. I did my PhD in Machine Learning in the University of Manchester and subsequently I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with AstraZeneca and Roche. I am honorary research fellow in [Machine Learning and Robotics](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/machine-learning-and-robotics/) in the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), while I am also a member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal [(MLJ)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10994/editorial-board) and the chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).

# News
**February 2025**: In our new paper [Using Individualized Treatment Effects to Assess Treatment Effect Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00713) we introduce methodologies for assessing heterogeneity using individualized treatment effects as a basis. These methods can be used to implement our recently proposed [WATCH workflow](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.2463) for binary and continuous endpoints. A big thanks to my Novartis co-authors ([Cong Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cong-zhang-58777514b/), [Sophie Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sun-hui-sophie-b7628581/), [Yao Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yao-chen-7967117b/), [Bj√∂rn Bornkamp](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=HX-5x8oAAAAJ)) and [Asher Spector](https://amspector100.github.io/) for a great collobartion.

**April 2024**: There is a PhD opportunity by [Gavin Brown](https://profgavinbrown.github.io/) in the UKRI AI Center for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Decision Making for Complex Systems (jointly run between the University of Manchester and the University of Cambridge). The [project](https://ai-decisions-cdt.github.io/hugo-pages/talk/2024_causaleffects_brown_sechidis_bretz/) will focus on the areas of causality and information geometry, with the main objective to study the statistical properties of various causal effect measures and understand/reduce their inherent uncertainty. [Frank Bretz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-bretz-8510415/) and I will also co-supervise/advise the student.

For those interested, Lasse's has a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/HansenLasse94/status/1434789476623060993) that summarizes some of the main points of the paper.

**Aug 2021**: On September 13th, together with colleagues from industry and academia, we organise the second edition of [PharML](https://sites.google.com/view/pharml2021/) workshop,  colocated with [ECML-PKDD 2021](https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/). Check the exciting program [here](https://sites.google.com/view/pharml2021/program). 

**Jul 2021**: The paper on using knockoffs for controlled predictive biomarker identification has just been published in [Statistics in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9134).

**Apr 2021**: The paper of my work in Roche is published and open access in [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365721000543).

**Oct 2020**: I am now member of the editorial board of the Machine Learning Journal [(MLJ)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10994/editorial-board). I also joined the [Treatment Effect Heterogeneity special interest group](https://psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/treatment-effect-heterogeneity), which is sponsored by the European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI) and the Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (PSI) organisation.

**Sept 2020**: On the September 18th I will present on the Statistical Learning workshop organised by the Data Mining and Machine Learning group of the University of Geneva. The aim of the workshop is to bring together the research communities of statistics and machine learning to foster a discussion between the two fields and develop research synergies. For more details and registration see here.

**June 2020**: I joined Novartis‚Äô Advanced Methodology and Data Science (AMDS) group, where I focus on developing novel machine learning methods with the aim of improving drug development in multiple projects. Furthermore, in collaboration with data scientists and biostatisticians, we work to ensure that state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methods are used at the trial and project level.
