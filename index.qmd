Hello, my name is Konstantinos (for short, Kostas) Sechidis and I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. I work in the Advanced Methodology and Data Science group of [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) and specialize in exploratory analysis for biomarker discovery, digital biomarker development, and assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials. I did my PhD in Machine Learning in the University of Manchester and subsequently I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with AstraZeneca and Roche. I am honorary research fellow in [Machine Learning and Robotics](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/machine-learning-and-robotics/) in the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), while I am also a member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal [(MLJ)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10994/editorial-board) and the chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).

# News
**January 2026**: Can we use data-driven methods to identify high-benefit or low-risk patient groups without compromising statistical integrity? Our new paper bridges the gap between exploratory and supportive analysis by introducing methods for controlled subgroup selection with guaranteed Type I error rates. A new step toward more reliable precision medicine. Huge thanks to [Manuel M. Müller](https://manuelmmueller.github.io/) (University of Cambridge) for leading this work, and to my co-authors from Novartis, Björn Bornkamp, [Frank Bretz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-bretz-8510415/) and [Nikolaos Sfikas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-sfikas-8479a6b/), and from academia [Timothy I. Cannings](https://webhomes.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tcannings/About_Me.html) (University of Edinburgh), [Wei Liu](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wxym9/professor-wei-liu) (University of Southampton), [Henry W. J. Reeve](https://henryreeve.netlify.app/) (Nanjing University), [Richard J. Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) (University of Cambridge), and [Fang Wan](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/fang-wan) (Lancaster University). Check it out the paper in [arXiv]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15676).

**December 2025**: Looking forward to presenting at the Workshop on Methods for Explaining Machine Learning, organized by the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. The workshop will take place on 4 February in Amsterdam and is free to attend. For more information and registration details, click [here](https://www.vvsor.nl/biometrics/events/methods-explainable-ml/).

**November 2025**: Happy to share our new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11166) with [Lasse](https://fischerl5.wordpress.com/), where we introduce  post-hoc knockoff method that uses e-values to adapt the nominal level while preserving full Type I error guarantees. In this way, we can increase the nominal level in cases where the original knockoff procedure does not make any selections to potentially make discoveries, and in cases where it does make discoveries, we can often decrease the nominal level to increase the precision.

**August 2025**: [Alberto](https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/alberto-parola)’s work on vocal markers of schizophrenia and the generalizability of machine learning models is published in [Schizophrenia Bulletin](https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaf124).

**May 2025**: I am happy to share our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01145) that is a product of a cross-industry collaboration initiated by the EFSPI (European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry) SIG in [Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (TEH)](https://psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/treatment-effect-heterogeneity). In this paper, we investigate the intersection of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) modeling and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to enhance the understanding of individual responses to treatments and the contribution of features in model predictions. Additionally, we provide guidance on using SHAP values to identify predictive biomarkers in CATE modeling. A big thanks to [David Svensson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-svensson-164b5816/) for leading this work, and to my co-authors [Erik Hermansson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-hermansson-7145b7116/), [Nikolaos Nikolaou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-nikolaou-60931986/) and [Ilya Lipkovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-lipkovich-2020411/).

**April 2025**: Our latest paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22548v1) illustrates the implementations of WATCH in the context of parametric regression models, highlighting the practical and flexible use of score-residual based methods for identifying treatment effect modifiers. A big thanks to [Sophie Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sun-hui-sophie-b7628581/), [Yao Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yao-chen-7967117b/) and [Björn Bornkamp](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=HX-5x8oAAAAJ)for leading this work.

**March 2025**: I am happy to present our recent work on assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in clinical trials at various events, including the [AI in Healthcare seminars at the University of Manchester](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/watch-workflow-to-assess-treatment-effect-heterogeneity-in-drug-development-tickets-1234546484769?aff=oddtdtcreator), [DAGstat 2025](https://dagstat2025.de/Guide/conference_guide.pdf), and the [ISBS webinar series](https://community.amstat.org/discussion/isbs-webinar-series-watch-a-workflow-to-assess-treatment-effect-heterogeneity-in-drug-development-for-clinical-trial-sponsors).

**February 2025**: In our new paper [Using Individualized Treatment Effects to Assess Treatment Effect Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00713) we introduce methodologies for assessing heterogeneity using individualized treatment effects as a basis. These methods can be used to implement our recently proposed [WATCH workflow](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.2463) for binary and continuous endpoints. A big thanks to my Novartis co-authors ([Cong Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cong-zhang-58777514b/), [Sophie Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sun-hui-sophie-b7628581/), [Yao Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yao-chen-7967117b/), [Björn Bornkamp](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=HX-5x8oAAAAJ)) and [Asher Spector](https://amspector100.github.io/) for a great collobartion.

**Sept 2020**: On the September 18th I will present on the Statistical Learning workshop organised by the Data Mining and Machine Learning group of the University of Geneva. The aim of the workshop is to bring together the research communities of statistics and machine learning to foster a discussion between the two fields and develop research synergies. For more details and registration see here.

**June 2020**: I joined Novartis’ Advanced Methodology and Data Science (AMDS) group, where I focus on developing novel machine learning methods with the aim of improving drug development in multiple projects.
