Hello, my name is Konstantinos (for short, Kostas) Sechidis and I am a machine learning researcher with experience in developing, enhancing and delivering novel statistical and machine learning methods tailored to healthcare analytics. I work in the Advanced Methodology and Data Science group of [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) and I am member of the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal [(MLJ)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994/editors) and vice-chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).




# News

**Nov 2023**: Gave an invited presentation in the European Statistical Forum. This year's topic was: [Statistical Methodology in Precision Medicine and the role of Artificial Intelligence](https://lsacademy.com/en/product/european-statistical-forum-4/).

**Sep 2023**: Present our work on controlled biomarker discovery in the [5th Conference of the Central European Network (CEN)](https://cen2023.github.io/home/index.html).

**Jan 2023**: I have been appointed vice-chair of the technical committee on [Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques](https://sites.google.com/view/iapr-tc1/home?pli=1) of the International Association for Pattern Recognition [(IAPR)](https://iapr.org/index.php).
